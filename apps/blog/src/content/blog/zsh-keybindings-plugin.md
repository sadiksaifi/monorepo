## Key Features

### Vim Mode with Visual Indicators

The plugin sets Vim keybindings as default with cursor appearance changes based on mode:

- Insert mode: Beam cursor (`|`)
- Command mode: Block cursor (`█`)

This visual distinction helps you immediately identify which mode you're in.

### Advanced Text Objects

Gain access to text objects for quotes and brackets in visual and operator-pending modes:

```
i', a'   - Inner/around single quotes
i", a"   - Inner/around double quotes
i`, a`   - Inner/around backticks
i(, a(   - Inner/around parentheses
i[, a[   - Inner/around square brackets
i{, a{   - Inner/around curly braces
i<, a<   - Inner/around angle brackets
ib, ab   - Inner/around block characters
```

### Emacs Keybindings in Insert Mode

Use familiar Emacs shortcuts when in insert mode:

```
Ctrl+A - Move to beginning of line
Ctrl+E - Move to end of line
Ctrl+P - Previous history item
Ctrl+N - Next history item
Ctrl+B - Move backward one character
Ctrl+F - Move forward one character
Ctrl+D - Delete character under cursor
Ctrl+K - Kill text to end of line
Ctrl+U - Kill text to beginning of line
Ctrl+W - Kill word backward
Ctrl+Y - Yank previously killed text
```

### Enhanced Navigation

The plugin provides improved navigation capabilities:

```
Home      - Go to beginning of line
End       - Go to end of line
PageUp    - Scroll up through history
PageDown  - Scroll down through history
Ctrl+←    - Move backward one word
Ctrl+→    - Move forward one word
```

### Menu Completion

Navigate completion menus with ease:

```
Tab       - Complete and show menu
Shift+Tab - Complete backward in menu
Ctrl+J    - Move down in completion menu
Ctrl+K    - Move up in completion menu
Ctrl+H    - Move left in completion menu
Ctrl+L    - Move right in completion menu
```
