# Monorepo and Project Structure

## Monorepo Management
- Follow best practices using Turbo for monorepo setups
- Ensure packages are properly isolated and dependencies are correctly managed
- Use shared configurations and scripts where appropriate
- Utilize the workspace structure as defined in the root `package.json` and `pnpm-workspace.yaml`

## Terminal Operations
- Always run `pwd` before executing any terminal command to verify your current directory position
- Working in the correct directory is crucial in a monorepo structure
- When navigating between workspaces, confirm your location before running package or build commands
- For workspace-specific commands, first navigate to the appropriate directory
- Remember that certain commands may need to be run from the monorepo root, while others from specific packages
- Use relative paths when appropriate to maintain context of your working directory

## Project Structure
- Follow the established project structure with separate packages for shared code and applications
- Use pnpm as the package manager (version 10.7.1 or higher)
- Ensure Node.js version 20 or higher is used
- Use environment variables consistently across the monorepo with proper validation
- Follow Turbo best practices for pipeline configuration and caching

## Environment Configuration
- Use environment variables for all configuration values that may change between environments
- Ensure all environment variables are properly validated at runtime
- Follow security best practices for handling sensitive information
- Use environment-specific configuration files (.env.local, .env.development, etc.)
- Document required environment variables in README files and in code comments
- Keep database credentials, API keys, and other secrets secure and never commit them to the repository
